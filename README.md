# Optical Recognition  App
<br>
<div style="text-align: center">Real time object detection game </div>

## Inspiration

Create an interactive game that evolves user moving around in the real world.

## What it does

The app suggests some random everyday life items to the user, and he has to move around, find and scan them. A level is accomplished if the given item is found. 

## How we built it

Using CoreML -Apple machine learning framework- to analyse the items, and some of the basic ios layout components. 

## Challenges we ran into

Finding a machine learning model that satisfies the following criterias : light-wight so it can be run locally on the device, and rich enough to recognise items with a high precision.

## What's next for OpticalRecognition-Demo

Improve the UI/UX. Add a countdown to make it more competitive. And why not to publish the final product on the App Store ! 

## Use instruction

Please download and copy [InceptionV3 Machine Learning Model] (https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/build-run-models/) to the project file

## About 

This is app is made during MLH Local Hack Day, a 12hours non stop worldwide hackathon. :bowtie:
